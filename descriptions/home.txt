What's up,

My name is Kwaku Agyapong, I major in Computer Science and French with a minor in Philosophy at Trinity College. I'm mainly interested in network administration and operations but when it comes to coding I'm most comfortable in Java. I also spend much of my free time workin on my homelab which I use to back up my devices as well as hosting some of my own data and services.

A lot of people ask me what French and Philosophy have to do with Computer Science. There is no relation. I speak Twi (Akan) at home, so growing up bilingual has given me an appreciation for the importance of language in culture in being a person. So when asked to pick a language in highschool I chose French and have stuck with it at first out of obligation and now, I like to think, out of tenured passion. 

I've alwas liked books. I attribute my earliest memory of getting "lost" in a story to the Magic Tree House series in second grade. Since I didn't grow up playing many games (which I'm working to correct now) I've had more than enough time to burn through enough novels to know that literature is important to me. In highschool, I started{italicize} to understand why literature is important in general. Why classics are classics, what makes a great work great and what it means to put ones experiences, thoughts, inhibitions to paper, or in some cases the screen- whether for themself or others. Hence, minoring in Philosophy. 

Thanks for reading this far, and for visiting my site and feel free to reach out. Have a great day !
