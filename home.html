        My name is Kwaku Agyapong, I major in <i>Computer Science</i> and
        <i>French</i> with a minor in Philosophy at Trinity College. I'm mainly
        interested in network administration and operations and when it comes to
        coding I'm most comfortable in Java. I also spend much of my free time
        workin on my homelab which I use to back up my devices as well as
        hosting some of my own data and services. A lot of people ask me what
        French and Philosophy have to do with Computer Science. There is no
        relation. But both are important to me.
